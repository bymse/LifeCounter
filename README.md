# Idea

Service to create a client-side realtime dashboard on a website. How it works:
1. Create the widget in "Admin"
2. Add the widget to the website
3. Push "props" to widget (props can specify some info about user, eg score)
4. Add the dashboard on the website
5. The dashboard is updating in realtime and shows the props from users

## Dashboard setup

Each widget can have multiple dashboards 
Each dashboard:
1. Is publicly avilable or not
2. View mode: default, only properties, json
3. List of allowed properties
